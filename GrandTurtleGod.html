    <h2>Why I Love Cross Country</h2>
    <p>Cross country is more than just running. It's about pushing yourself beyond limits you never thought possible, bonding with teammates, and feeling the satisfaction of crossing the finish line. Every race is a battle with yourself, but each practice makes you stronger, both mentally and physically.</p>

    <h2>My Daily Routine</h2>
    <p>On a typical day, our team meets right after school to hit the trails. Warm-ups, dynamic stretching, and then we're off. Sometimes it's an easy recovery run, other times we're doing hill repeats or speed work. After practice, it's all about recoveryâ€”hydrating, stretching, and refueling.</p>
